# Lab1 
8 from List 1 (Graph and Tree)
6 from List 2 (Set of dices)

List1:

	Class Graph 
	methods:
		1. add vertex
		2. add edge
		3. search connected components 
		4. minimum spanning tree (returns Graph)
		5. topological sort
		6. print 

	Class Tree 
	methods:
		1. convert Graph to Tree
		2. print
		3. add vertex

	Basic level - ****
	Extra - * (minimum spanning tree)
	Total - *****

List2:
	Class Dice
	methods:
	
		1. add side
		2. check valid
		3. print
		4. create random dice

	Class SetDices methods:
		1. add dice
		2. print
		3. get probability for each sum
		4. expected sum
		5. overloaded operation < (by expected sum)	 
	Basic level - ***
	Extra - * overloaded operation <
	Total - ****
	
Also all methods were tested via googletest
All tests are in directory tests
I hope for additional points :)  	
Total count - 9
